# Responsive Portfolio

A responsive portfolio is an important tool for any web developer, in order to show the developer's capabilities to create mobile-first and responsive applications. This application will have a home page, contact page, and a portfolio page. These pages should link to each other and respond to screen sizes appropriately.
