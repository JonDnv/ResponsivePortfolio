            <p>I am a Microsoft SQL Server Database Administrator for a relatil pharmaceutical company. I've been at my current position for almost four years. Prior to that, I worked as a 911 operator and administrator for 15 years. During that time, I also went to school fulltime to earn my Associates of Science degree in Business Administration. I have varied careers in my life and never thought this would be my path, but I'm grateful for each career I've had.</p>
            <p>I moved to Colorado 4 years ago, in 2016 for my career and to follow my fream of moving west and away from the South. There have been some tough moments and definitely some things to get used to but ultimately it was the best decision in my life. I've taken up hiking, snowshoeing, backpacking, and camping extensively. I've yet to take up any of the widely available winter sports here, like skiing and snowboarding. My favorite place to hike is Crater Lakes near Moffat Tunnel. It's incredibly beautiful and a bit of a hidden gem so it's nice to get away from the hustle and bustle</p>
            <p>One of my great passions is greyhounds and greyhound rescue. My current dog, OshKosh P Diddy, raced in Floriday many years ago but is 12 now and has been with me four years. I'd have multiple hounds, but I'm not sure Diddy would forgive me as he enjoys his space and solitude. Greyhounds live a tough life while they're racing (though not as tough as many think) and deserve good homes. I always try to encourage people looking for a dog to consider a greyhound. They are gentle and patient and don't need much exercise as most think. They make wonderful apartment dogs, as many large dogs do. Please consider adopting a greyhound or feel free to ask me more questions about them.</p>
